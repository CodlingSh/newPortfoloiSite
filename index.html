                <p>Since I was four years old, I have always enjoyed working, playing, and creating on computers. Memories of our family-owned 386-based PC are still fresh in my mind, as it gave me my first exposure to the world of computers. From those humble beginnings, I developed a deep understanding of several Linux distributions and Windows. Consequently, my love for computers has been growing ever since.</p>
                <p>My computer-relevant post-secondary educational background dates back to 2013, where I took the “Computer Network Specialist” course at Lambton College. In that program, I studied system repair, Network Setup, Cisco equipment, and computer/server maintenance. After a few years of few years of saving up money, I decided to further my education by enrolling in the “Computer Programmer” course at Lambton College.</p>
                <p>As of writing, I am a recent graduate of the “Computer Programmer” course. My formal training has laid a solid foundation that I hope to build on in my future career. Through the course, I have gained an in-depth understanding of HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I have acquired self-taught skills in Lua, C, and Bash.</p>
                <p>I have created a notable reputation and tech presence for people I've interacted with through my programming life. Some of my achievements include designing, coding, and maintaining a website for a local business and a JavaScript-based password generator that I use to generate all my passwords.</p>
                <p>For me, the sky is the limit, and I hope to live to embrace the core values of innovation and technology. When I’m not studying or programming, I enjoy playing video games, graphic design, mountain biking, playing chess, watching action or sci-fi movies, and toying around with Linux distributions.</p>
                <p>Thanks for taking the time to get to know me better. If you have any questions for me, please contact me.</p>
